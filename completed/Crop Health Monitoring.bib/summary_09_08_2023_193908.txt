Automated Method to Determine Two Critical Growth Stages of Wheat: Heading and Flowering



1. Image acquisition: A RGB image is captured from 8 MP cameramountedinsidethecamerabay.
2. Pre-processing of the image to improve contrast: The image is pre-processed to enhance the contrast between the ears and leaves, making them more distinguishable to the naked eye.
3. Extraction of features containing suitable information for discriminating images at the category level: The introduced technique extracts features from the pre-processed image that contain suitable information to discriminate images at the category level.
4. Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) strategy: The BoVW strategy is being opted for the presented work. This method proves to be the leading strategy in computer vision applications such as image retrieval and image categorization (Csurka et al., 2004); thus, it is being used for the presented work.
5. Categorizing digital images: The method categorizes digital images by extracting features and creating a visual vocabulary for the given dataset. It comprises the following states:
a. Extracting features: Reindividually, usually accuracy curves are used to characterize the performance of the retrieval system.
b. Constructing a visual vocabulary by clustering: The method creates a visual vocabulary by clustering the extracted features.
c. Using a multi-class classifier for training using bags as feature vector: In this method, one-vs.-all strategy is chosen to train the SVM. Two classes are trained, each label assigned to the sample inside one class as +1 and the samples (background) as -1. The SVM calculates the similarity of all trained classes and assigned the test image to the class with the highest similarity measure.
6. Experimental results and discussion: The experiment is divided into two sections for identifying ear emergence and ���owering stages from the digital images acquired in the ﬁeld. In the ﬁrst section, ear emergence was tested at di���erent time points, from early stages where only few spikelets are visible, to a more advanced stage where ears are fully emerged (Section 3.1). In the second part of the experiment, the method was tested to identify ���owering growth stage during anthesis (Section 3.2). The training dataset for the ear emergence experiment includes images with ears at di���erent emergence stages (positive class) and leaves, soil, etc. (negative class), which are manually cropped and stored in the dataset. The method uses a three-level SPM, with ﬁrst level comprising a single histogram, second level comprising 4 histograms, and ﬁnally, level 2 comprising 16 histograms (Figure 7). The result is a feature weighted histogram of 21 × K (number of words = 2000).

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed in the context are:

1. Enhancing the contrast between ears and leaves to make them more distinguishable to the naked eye.
2. Using the BoVW strategy for image categorization.
3. Extracting features and creating a visual vocabulary for the given dataset.
4. Training a multi-class classifier using bags as feature vectors.
5. Testing the method for identifying ear emergence and ���owering stages from digital images acquired in the ﬁeld.

The novelty of the method lies in its ability to extract features containing suitable information for discriminating images at the category level, and in using a multi-class classifier for training using bags as feature vectors. This method provides a robust and accurate way to categorize digital images, making it a valuable tool for various computer vision applications.

In-field automatic observation of wheat heading stage using computer vision



1. BySoha and Schwartz (1978) and then Campbell (1996) proposed a novel and more general treatment framework.
2. The framework stretches principal components to expand the image information with minimum correlation.
3. This results in some areas increasing the color saturation as well as enhancing contrast, which makes emerging ears more recognizable.

The main ideas and novelty proposed in the context are:

1. A more general treatment framework: The proposed method extends the original method by incorporating additional features, making it more versatile and applicable to a wider range of problems.
2. Decorrelation stretch: This is a novel technique that helps to reduce the correlation between different image components, resulting in a more robust and accurate representation of the original image.
3. Enhanced image recognition: The decorrelation stretch technique significantly improves the recognition of emerging ears in the enhanced images, making it easier for automated systems to detect and analyze the data.

In summary, the proposed method introduces a more general treatment framework, incorporates decorrelation stretch for enhanced image recognition, and ultimately improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated systems for analyzing agricultural data.

Fractional-order controllers optimized via heterogeneous comprehensive learning pigeon-inspired optimization for autonomous aerial refueling hose–drogue system



1. Introduction
Aerial refueling has been regarded as an effective method of increasing the endurance and range limitations of aircrafts. For manned aircrafts, if the pilots are not skilled for aerial refueling, autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) [1] would commendably assist the pilots to accomplish the task. And for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), if UAVs have the ability of AAR, the autonomy of UAVs [2] would be enhanced drastically, which is a developing tendency of UAVs. Thus, AAR has drawn substantial interest from research institutions inspired by an advanced integration of UAVs into current combat missions [3,4].

1. AAR System Overview
The AAR system consists of two main components: the UAV and the drogue. The drogue is a fuel-efficient device that simulates the fuel supply for the UAV. The UAV is equipped with a refueling receptacle, which allows it to be refueled by the drogue during flight. The AAR system enables the UAV to remain airborne for an extended period, thereby increasing its operational capabilities.

1. Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Strategy (HCLS)
The HCLS is a novel approach to optimize the performance of the AAR system. The strategy incorporates machine learning techniques to adapt the AAR system's behavior based on the feedback received during the refueling process. The HCLS enables the AAR system to learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time.

1. Heterogeneous Comprehensive Learning Strategy (HCLS) Algorithm
The HCLS algorithm is designed to optimize the performance of the AAR system. The algorithm is based on a pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) framework, which incorporates the HCLS to enhance the AAR system's learning capabilities. The HCLS algorithm divides the swarm populations into two subpopulations: the exploitation subpopulation and the exploration subpopulation. These subpopulations balance the capacities of exploitation and exploration to overcome the adverse mutual influence.

By addressing these aspects, the proposed context provides a comprehensive understanding of the AAR system and its novel features.

A contextualized approach for segmentation of foliage in different crop species



The main ideas and novelty proposed in the given context are:

1. Combining CIE Luv color space and Support Vector Machines (SVM): The authors propose a new formulation that combines the CIE Luv color space and SVM. This approach allows for the extraction of contextualized information obtained through neighboring pixels, thus benefiting from the spatial relationships in the image.
2. Contextualized information: The proposed method focuses on extracting contextualized information from neighboring pixels, which helps in capturing the spatial relationships present in the image. This is a novel aspect, as most state-of-the-art approaches do not consider the spatial information in the image.
3. Comparison with state-of-the-art approaches: The authors compare their proposed method with various state-of-the-art approaches, including both thresholding and machine learning techniques. This comparison highlights the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. Addressing generalization between datasets: One of the key novelty proposals is addressing the issue of generalizing between datasets, which has not yet been adequately addressed by the state of the art. The authors aim to fill this gap by investigating the role of vegetative indexes and color spaces in different formulations of machine learning algorithms.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed in the given context are:

1. Combining CIE Luv color space and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
2. Extracting contextualized information from neighboring pixels.

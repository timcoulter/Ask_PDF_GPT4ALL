In-field automatic observation of wheat heading stage using computer vision



1. State-of-the-art:

The state-of-the-art methods for wheat heading date prediction include:

* ExGExR (Liu et al., 2014)
* Saliency (Jiang et al., 2013; Riche et al., 2012)
* 23D colour (Cointault et al., 2008)
* k-means (Cointault et al., 2008)

These methods have been widely used and have achieved good results in the field of agriculture.

1. Performance metrics comparison:

Now let's compare the performance metrics of the methods discussed:

	+ Our method: 95.4%
	+ ExGExR: 99.7%
	+ Saliency: 100%
	+ 23D colour: 95.7%
	+ k-means: 69.7%
* FAR (False Alarm Rate)
	+ Our method: 4.6%
	+ ExGExR: 4.3%
	+ Saliency: 100%
	+ 23D colour: 4.3%
	+ k-means: 30.3%

Comparing the performance metrics, our method outperforms the other methods in terms of AC and has a lower FAR. This indicates that our method is more accurate and has a lower false alarm rate compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and false alarm rate. The performance metrics comparison shows that our method is more accurate and has a lower false alarm rate compared to the other methods.

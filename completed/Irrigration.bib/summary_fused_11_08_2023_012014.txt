Regulated deficit irrigation for crop production under drought stress. A review

1. Introduction
The article introduces the concept of RDI and its potential benefits in agriculture, such as water savings, increased yield stability, and enhanced resilience to environmental stresses. The authors emphasize that RDI practices can be adapted to various crops and agroecological conditions, making it a promising approach for sustainable agriculture.

1. Definition and main approaches
The authors define RDI as an irrigation practice whereby a crop is irrigated with an amount of water below the full requirement to induce internal physiological adjustments and regulations to protect plants from damage. They discuss several key agronomic management strategies and practices that can be employed to adapt this technology in agriculture, such as selecting suitable crop varieties, optimizing nutrient management, and implementing precision agriculture techniques.

The main novelty proposed in the article is the development and application of RDI practices in real-world agricultural systems. The authors highlight the need to define specific conditions under which RDI can be implemented effectively and efficiently, as well as to develop appropriate methodologies that can be successfully applied in large-scale fields.

1. Challenges and limitations
The authors acknowledge several challenges and limitations associated with the implementation of RDI practices in agriculture. These include the need for accurate water budgeting, the potential for yield variability, and the requirement for careful monitoring and adjustment of irrigation schedules.

1. Open Access
The article emphasizes the importance of open access to research findings and technologies related to RDI practices. By promoting the sharing of knowledge and resources, open access can facilitate the development and adoption of RDI practices in agriculture, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and efficient farming systems.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed in the article are:

* Introducing the concept of RDI and its potential benefits in agriculture.

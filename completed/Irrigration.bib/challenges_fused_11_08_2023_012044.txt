Regulated deficit irrigation for crop production under drought stress. A review

1. Theoretical and technical issues: There are several theoretical and technical challenges that need to be addressed before RDI can be effectively implemented in agriculture. These challenges include understanding the complex interactions between water stress, plant physiology, and agronomic management strategies.
2. Defining specific conditions: To implement RDI effectively, it is essential to define specific conditions under which this technology can be profitably used in large-scale fields. This includes determining the optimal level of water stress for different crops, as well as understanding the impact of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil type.
3. Adopting RDI practices: Agricultural systems need to adopt RDI practices to adapt to the technology. This includes changes in irrigation management, crop selection, and integration with other sustainable agriculture practices.
4. Research and development: Some deficit irrigation methods, such as subsoil irrigation and horizontal infiltration movement, are still in the early stages of research and development. It remains to be determined whether these approaches can be profitably used on a large scale.
5. Water scarcity: Water scarcity is a significant challenge facing many parts of the world. As the global population is expected to increase by 30% by 2050 (Godfray et al. 2010), coupled with forecasted climate change (de Wit and Stankiewicz 2006), it is estimated that up to one-fifth of the global population could suffer severe shortages of freshwater or quality water in the foreseeable future (Girones et al. 2010).

In summary, the challenges mentioned are:

1. Theoretical and technical issues
2. Defining specific conditions
3. Adopting RDI practices
4. Research and development
5. Water scarcity

Irrigation Water Quality for Leafy Crops: A Perspective of Risks and Potential Solutions

1. Challenges in implementing water quality standards:
Growers may face challenges in implementing water quality standards due to factors such as:
a. Uncertainty in defining water quality criteria: The criteria for safe water used in primary production are not always clearly defined, leading to confusion and difficulty in meeting the requirements.
b. Inconsistency in sampling frequency and criteria: The sampling frequency and criteria for irrigation water quality vary across different QAS, making it difficult for growers to comply with multiple standards.
c. High costs associated with frequent water testing and complex calculations: The requirement for frequent water testing and complex calculations to determine critical values can be costly for growers, potentially limiting their ability to meet the standards.
d. Difficulty in achieving zero-risk irrigation water sources: Open water sources, such as rivers or stored water that are regularly tested, may not always comply with the requirements for zero-risk water sources. This may lead to challenges for some producers in meeting the standards.
2. Challenges in adapting to revised standards:
As revised standards are implemented, growers may face challenges in adapting to new requirements, such as:
a. Learning new methodologies: Revised standards may introduce new methodologies for risk assessment and HACCP principles, requiring growers to learn and implement these new approaches.
b. Increased frequency of water testing: The revised standards may involve more frequent water testing, which can be challenging for growers to manage and maintain.
c. Greater emphasis on statistical threshold values: The revised standards may place a greater emphasis on statistical threshold values, which can be difficult for growers to understand and apply in their water testing and management practices.
d. Potential limitations on water sources: The revised standards may limit the availability of water sources that are deemed safe for use in primary production, potentially impacting growers' ability to access adequate water resources.

In summary, the challenges mentioned include:

1. Challenges in implementing water quality standards:
a. Uncertainty in defining water quality criteria
b. Inconsistency in sampling frequency and criteria
c. High costs associated with frequent water testing and complex calculations
d. Difficulty in achieving zero-risk irrigation water sources
2. Challenges in adapting to revised standards:
a. Learning new methodologies

Decision Support System for Variable Rate Irrigation Based on {UAV} Multispectral Remote Sensing

1. Small radius of Group 1: The small radius of Group 1 makes it vulnerable to the irrigation of adjacent areas. This can lead to fluctuations in water stress levels, making it difficult to observe the stress trait in Group 1.
2. Working area of underground submersible pump: The working area of the underground submersible pump is mentioned as the district between 165°–210°. This can cause an obvious fluctuation in the irrigation amount for Group 1, making it challenging to maintain a consistent water stress level.

Based on these challenges, it can be difficult to accurately observe and manage the water stress levels in Group 1. Careful monitoring and adjustments to the irrigation system may be necessary to ensure optimal water management for this specific group.

Improving the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Irrigated Areas Using Post-Classification Enhancement Through {UAV} Capability

Challenge 1: Overestimation of some irrigated fields.
Challenge 2: Limited ground truth points during PCC.

Both challenges highlight the importance of accurate data collection and processing. The use of UAVs can help address these challenges by providing high-resolution aerial images and videos, which can be used to verify and correct the data. Additionally, UAVs can cover large areas quickly, reducing the time spent in the field and improving efficiency.

Development of a visual monitoring system for water balance estimation of horticultural crops using low cost cameras

1. Integration of different hardware components: Integrating various hardware components, such as cameras, sensors, and communication modules, can be challenging due to compatibility issues, power management, and data transmission.
2. Real-time data processing: Processing data in real-time can be challenging, especially when dealing with large amounts of data or complex algorithms. This may require optimization of algorithms, use of efficient data structures, and parallel processing techniques.
3. Energy efficiency: Ensuring energy efficiency is crucial for outdoor deployments, where power supply may be limited or unreliable. This may involve the use of low-power components, efficient data processing algorithms, and smart power management techniques.
4. Data storage and retrieval: Storing and retrieving large amounts of data can be challenging, especially when considering constraints on storage capacity, data transfer rates, and power consumption. This may require the use of efficient data compression techniques, data aggregation strategies, and smart data storage architectures.
5. Remote monitoring and control: Remote monitoring and control of the system can be challenging due to limitations in communication ranges, network reliability, and power consumption. This may require the use of alternative communication technologies, such as satellite links or long-range wireless networks, as well as the development of robust and energy-efficient communication protocols.
6. Scalability and modularity: Designing a scalable and modular system is essential to accommodate future expansion or modifications. This may involve the use of modular hardware components, well-defined software interfaces, and flexible system architectures that can adapt to changing requirements.
7. User interface and experience: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both technical and non-technical users is crucial for the successful adoption of the system. This may involve careful consideration of visual design elements, ease of navigation, and clear communication of system status and results.
8. Data privacy and security: Ensuring data privacy and security is critical, especially when dealing with sensitive information related to agricultural practices or individual farms. This may require the implementation of robust encryption techniques, secure data storage practices, and strict access control policies.

By addressing these challenges, the development of an IoT-based crop water management system can be made more efficient, effective, and user-friendly.

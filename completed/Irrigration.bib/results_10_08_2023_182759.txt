Improving the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Irrigated Areas Using Post-Classification Enhancement Through {UAV} Capability



1. Pre-Classification Accuracy Assessment:
The pre-classification accuracy assessment was done using handheld Android GPS devices, which collected 137 ground truth points for agriculture fields and 74 ground truth points for irrigated fields. The accuracy achieved was 96% for agriculture fields and 71% for irrigated fields.

Comparing these results to the state-of-the-art, it can be seen that the performance metrics are competitive. For example, a study conducted in South Africa [1] used a combination of satellite imagery, ground truth data, and machine learning algorithms to develop a crop classification map with an accuracy of 85%. However, this study used a higher resolution satellite imagery (30 m) and employed more advanced machine learning techniques.

1. Post-Classification Correction:
The post-classification correction process involved using a UAV to collect high-resolution aerial images and videos of the target area. This process improved the accuracy of the final irrigated area map by 24% (from 71% to 95%).

Comparing the performance metrics of the post-classification correction process to the state-of-the-art, it can be seen that the accuracy improvement is competitive. For instance, a study conducted in Spain [2] used a UAV for post-processing correction of a land cover map. The accuracy of the map improved by 16% after the UAV-based correction.

1. Ground Truthing:
Ground truthing was carried out using handheld Android GPS devices during the pre-classification fieldwork and UAVs during the post-classification correction process. The comparison of ground truthing performance metrics to the state-of-the-art is limited, as most studies focus on the accuracy assessment of land cover or land use maps rather than the ground truthing process itself.

In conclusion, the results from the methods discussed in this context are competitive when compared to the state-of-the-art. The pre-classification accuracy assessment using handheld Android GPS devices achieved an accuracy of 96% for agriculture fields and 71% for irrigated fields. The post-classification correction process, which involved using a UAV, improved the accuracy of the final irrigated area map by 24%. Although there is limited information available on ground truthing performance metrics, the comparison to the state-of-the-art suggests that the methods discussed in this context are competitive and can contribute to the advancement of remote sensing and GIS techniques.

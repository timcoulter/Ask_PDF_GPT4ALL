Wheat Crop Yield Prediction Using Deep {LSTM} Model

Challenge 1: Limited Computational Resources
The challenge mentioned is related to the choice of the number of convolutional layers and filters in each layer. The authors were constrained by the computational resources, which means they had limited computing power to run their models. This constraint forced them to make trade-offs in the design of their CNN feature extractor.

Deep Gaussian Process for Crop Yield Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Data

1. Baseline models: These are traditional statistical models, such as ridge regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. They are widely used in agricultural forecasting, but they often lack the ability to capture complex relationships or nonlinear patterns in the data.
2. Deep learning models: These are neural networks with multiple layers, such as deep belief networks (DBNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They have shown great potential in handling large-scale, high-dimensional data, but they may suffer from overfitting or require a large amount of training data.
3. LSTM models: These are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, which can capture long-term dependencies in the data. They have been successfully applied to various time series prediction tasks, including agricultural yield forecasting.
4. Our proposed model: This combines the advantages of all the above methods by incorporating a Gaussian process (GP) regression for uncertainty quantification and spatial correlation modeling. The GP component helps reduce spatially correlated errors and improves the overall prediction performance.

Comparing the performance metrics of these methods, our proposed model with the GP component consistently outperforms the baseline models and deep learning models. The LSTM model, while still performing well, does not achieve the same level of improvement as our proposed model with the GP component.

In summary, our proposed model with the GP component significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in agricultural yield forecasting. The GP component helps reduce spatially correlated errors and improves the overall prediction performance, demonstrating the capability of the model to capture complex relationships and nonlinear patterns in the data.

1. 1-D CNN Model:
The 1-D CNN model showed a high accuracy with an R2 of 0.83, a P value of <0.001, and an RMSE of 636.79 kg/ha. Although the 1-D CNN model did not outperform the state-of-the-art, it still demonstrated a strong performance in yield estimation. For instance, a study by Li et al. (2020) reported an R2 of 0.87 and an RMSE of 626.8 kg/ha using a 1-D CNN model for wheat yield prediction in China.

In summary, all three models (LSTM, 1-D CNN, and RF) achieved high accuracy in yield estimation, with the LSTM model showing the best performance among the three. Although the performance metrics of the LSTM model were not significantly higher than those of the 1-D CNN and RF models, the LSTM model still demonstrated a strong performance in yield estimation, comparable to or even better than some state-of-the-art studies.

1. LASSO: LASSO is a regularization technique that can be used for feature selection. It aims to find the best subset of features by minimizing the sum of the squared errors between the observed and predicted values. LASSO is known for its ability to identify important features while simultaneously performing variable selection.
2. RF: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. RF works by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase, and then aggregating their predictions. This approach helps to capture complex relationships in the data and leads to better generalization performance.
3. LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is specifically designed to handle sequences with variable length and complex temporal dependencies. LSTM units can learn long-term dependencies and can effectively capture the temporal patterns in the data.

Comparing the results from these methods to the state-of-the-art, we can see that LASSO and RF are widely used in various applications, including yield estimation. However, these methods may not be able to capture the complex temporal patterns present in the data. In contrast, LSTM has shown promising results in modeling time-series data, including yield estimation.

When comparing the performance metrics, we can see that LASSO and RF generally provide good performance in terms of RMSE and R 2 . However, when compared to LSTM, these methods may not be able to achieve the same level of accuracy and consistency in estimating yields.

In summary, the results from the methods discussed (LASSO, RF, and LSTM) compare favorably to the state-of-the-art in yield estimation. LSTM, in particular, has shown promising results in capturing complex temporal patterns in the data, which may lead to improved accuracy and consistency in estimating yields.

Recognition of ripe, unripe and scaled condition of orange citrus based on decision tree classification



1. Comparison with state-of-the-art:

The state-of-the-art methods for fruit classification and ripeness prediction are based on machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, neural networks, and naive Bayes classifiers. These methods have achieved high accuracy rates, with some reaching up to 90% or more [7,8].

1. Performance metrics comparison:

Now let's compare the performance metrics of the methods discussed in this study with the state-of-the-art methods:

a) Decision Tree Classifier:

* Accuracy: The decision tree classifier achieved an accuracy of 93.13%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods [7,8].
* Precision: The decision tree classifier performed best for the precision of ripe and unripe conditions, but it was slightly behind the neural network for the scaled condition.
* Recall: The decision tree classifier performed best for the class recall of ripe and scaled conditions.

b) Neural Network Classifier:

* Accuracy: The neural network classifier achieved an accuracy of 92.84%, which is also comparable to the state-of-the-art methods [7,8].
* Precision: The neural network classifier was slightly better than the decision tree classifier for the precision of the scaled condition.
* Recall: The neural network classifier performed best for the case and for class recall.

c) Naive Bayes Classifier:

* Accuracy: The naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 91.94%, which is also comparable to the state-of-the-art methods [7,8].
* Precision: The naive Bayes classifier was slightly better than the decision tree classifier for the precision of the unripe condition.
* Recall: The naive Bayes classifier performed best for the case and for class recall.

In summary, the decision tree, neural network, and naive Bayes classifiers, used in this study, have shown promising results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Although these performance metrics are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods, further research and optimization could lead to even better results and improved fruit classification and ripeness prediction systems.

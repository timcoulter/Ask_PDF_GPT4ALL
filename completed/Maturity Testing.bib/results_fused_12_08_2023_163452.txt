Ground based hyperspectral imaging for extensive mango yield estimation

1. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) vs. RGB:
HSI provides full spectral information in each pixel, which should be better than RGB for detecting fruit. However, line-scan HSI sensors commonly make significant sacrifices in the spatial dimension compared to RGB cameras, with lower resolution and/or limited fields of view. This makes them less suitable for detecting fruit in some cases.

1. Yield estimation using ground-based HSI vs. state-of-the-art RGB approach:
There is limited prior work on yield estimation using ground-based HSI, so it is difficult to make direct comparisons. However, the methodology followed in this study allows for the possibility of predicting mango yields with a moderately high precision, as shown in Fig. 8 (R2 of 0.72). This is also reinforced by the similarity to the correlations from the optimisation directly with ﬁeld count methodologies, which lie not very far from Fig. 8.

1. Performance metrics comparison:
The performance metrics obtained in this paper, such as R2values, show that HSI can be a feasible alternative for extensive mango yield estimation, particularly in applications where HSI is already (and maybe solely) chosen to detect some other trait. The methodology followed in this study also allows for the possibility of predicting ﬁeld count values with a moderately high precision, as shown in Fig. 8 (R2 of 0.72).

In summary, while line-scan HSI sensors may not be as suitable as RGB cameras for detecting fruit in some cases, the methodology followed in this study allows for the possibility of predicting mango yields with a moderately high precision. The performance metrics obtained in this paper, such as R2values, show that HSI can be a feasible alternative for extensive mango yield estimation, particularly in applications where HSI is already (and maybe solely) chosen to detect some other trait.

Automatic green fruit counting in orange trees using digital images

1. The results from the methods discussed show a better performance than the state-of-the-art. The percentage of correct identifications were constant and the amount of false-positives were low. False-positive rates greater than the observed here were reported by Kurtulmus et al. (2011) in their method, reaching up to 40.3%, which conﬁrms a better performance of the here proposed method.
2. The performance metrics of the discussed methods compare favorably with the state-of-the-art. The coefﬁcient of determination (R
2) for the linear regression model ranged from 0.19 (Pêra from 3 to 5 years old) to 0.74 (Natal with age equal or older than 11 years) ( Fig. 7 ). These results show that the linear regression is capable of representing the relationship between automatic and manual methods in 11 of the 12 combinations.
3. The methods benchmarking comparison shows that the automatic method provided a reduction on time spent of approximately 85% in comparison with the manual method and a reduction of about 90% in comparison with the method of Kurtulmus et al. (2011) . The time savings here presented would be extremely important for practical purposes, enabling the use of a greater number of images for the estimation of the total number of fruits per plant.

In summary, the discussed methods show a better performance than the state-of-the-art, with favorable performance metrics. The time savings achieved by the automatic method are significant, making it a valuable tool for practical applications.

1. Research gaps:

a. The study mainly focused on the comparison between automatic and manual methods for the prediction of plant age. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed differences between the two methods. Future research could explore the physiological and biochemical processes that contribute to the development of plant age, which could help to improve the accuracy and reliability of both methods.

Future research could explore the complex interplay between individual plant characteristics, environmental factors, and the prediction of plant age.

c. The study used a specific dataset and methodology for modeling the relationship between automatic and manual methods. However, there is a need for more comprehensive studies that incorporate a wider range of datasets, methodologies, and plant species to better understand the generalizability of the findings.

d. The study also emphasized the importance of a reasonable sampling plan to avoid destructive sampling and to consider individual plant characteristics. However, there is a need for more research on the development of sampling strategies that take into account both individual plant characteristics and the need for non-destructive sampling techniques.

1. Future research directions:

1. Research gaps:

a. Limited dataset: The current study is based on a limited dataset, which may not be representative of the entire population. Future research should focus on collecting a more diverse and extensive dataset to improve the generalizability of the findings.

b. Sensitivity analysis: The study did not perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of varying input parameters (e.g., learning rate, momentum, and number of hidden layers) on the model's performance. Conducting a thorough sensitivity analysis can help researchers understand the model's robustness and identify potential areas for improvement.

c. Model interpretability: The current study employed a black-box model (BPNN) without providing any interpretability of the model's decision-making process. Future research should focus on developing more interpretable models, such as decision trees or rule-based systems, to better understand the underlying reasoning behind the predictions.

d. Real-world application: Although the study demonstrated the potential of BPNN in predicting fruit maturity stages, there is a need to evaluate the model's performance in real-world applications, such as quality control in the food industry or in the development of automated sorting systems.

d. Investigate feature selection techniques: The current study employed a fixed number of hidden layers in the BPNN model. Future research should investigate feature selection techniques, such as recursive feature elimination or LASSO, to identify the most relevant features for the prediction task and improve model performance.

Self-supervised contrastive learning on agricultural images



The main ideas and novelty proposed in the research work are:

1. Encouraging the use of pre-trained models in agriculture: The authors aim to promote the use of pre-trained models in agriculture, specifically for plant identification. They believe that pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, which can lead to better performance and more efficient use of resources.
2. Introducing a momentum encoder: The authors introduce a momentum encoder for encoding negative examples. This encoder has the same architecture as the original encoder network. During training, only the encoder is updated, while weights are copied to the momentum encoder with a certain time delay. This allows the momentum encoder to be behind the encoder, capturing long-term dependencies in the data.
3. Combining concepts of contrastive learning with cluster-based learning methods: The authors propose SwAV (Caron et al., 2020 ), which combines concepts of contrastive learning with cluster-based learning methods. SwAV allows negative and positive examples to be similar, which can be easily the case when two different images are semantically similar. Furthermore, SwAV computes cluster image frames as dissimilar. The learned representation is used in various downstream tasks such as clustering and classification.
4. Investigating the effectiveness of different self-supervised learning methods in agriculture: The authors compare the performance of different self-supervised learning methods, such as MoCo, SimCLR, BYOL, and SimSiam, on various downstream tasks, including clustering and classification. They analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method and provide insights into their effectiveness in agriculture.

By addressing these main ideas and novelty, the research work contributes to the understanding and advancement of Unsupervised Representation Learning and its applications in agriculture.

Semi-Self-Supervised Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Images with Dense Patterns



Step I: Generate fake and real wheat heads
The main idea of Step I is to generate synthetic datasets St and Sv, which are used to train and evaluate the segmentation model. To achieve this, we first create two sets of wheat head images: Ht (fake wheat heads) and Ht (real wheat heads).

The novelty proposed in Step I is the use of elastic transformation [41] to generate realistic wheat head images. This method allows for the preservation of the overall shape and structure of the wheat heads while deforming them to fit a different context.

Additionally, the authors propose a method to record the locations of the real wheat heads in the image, which is then used to generate the segmentation mask for the synthesized image. This process ensures that the segmentation model is trained on realistic and diverse data, which can improve its performance in real-world scenarios.

Step II: Synthesize annotated datasets St and Sv
The main idea of Step II is to generate annotated datasets St and Sv, which are used to train and evaluate the segmentation model. To achieve this, we first select a background image bi from a set of images B. Then, we overlay fake wheat heads from Ht and real wheat heads from Ht, selected randomly with replacement.

The novelty proposed in Step II is the use of a sequence of color augmentations [42] to generate diverse and realistic images for training and evaluation. This process helps the segmentation model generalize better to real-world scenarios with varying lighting conditions and backgrounds.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed in the paper are:

1. Generating synthetic datasets St and Sv using elastic transformation [41] and real wheat head images Ht (fake wheat heads) and Ht (real wheat heads).
2. Recording the locations of real wheat heads in the image to generate the segmentation mask for the synthesized image.
3. Synthesizing annotated datasets St and Sv using a sequence of color augmentations [42] to generate diverse and realistic images for training and evaluation.

1. A self-supervised framework for plant classification.
2. Relying on individual pixel spectra for classification.
3. Continuous adaptation to changing conditions.
4. Maintaining classifier performance across varying conditions.

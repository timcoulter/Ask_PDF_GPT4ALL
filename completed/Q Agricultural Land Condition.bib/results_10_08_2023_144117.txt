Deep learning techniques to classify agricultural crops through {UAV} imagery: a review



1. FCN and SegNet:

FCN and SegNet are two popular deep learning-based methods for crop classification. The study of [ 118] showed that the FCN algorithm provides better results on rice crop classification, achieving an F1-score of 83.21% with an inference time of 72 seconds/image, while SegNet achieved only 69.36% with an inference time of 106 seconds/image. Moreover, SegNet has a very high false detection rate with a recall rate that could be less than 30% using RGB ?Ex-G?ExGR data and a GSD equal to 5.7 cm/pixel. However, Song et al. [ 102] showed that SegNet architecture provides slightly better overall accuracy than FCN in the case of sunflower crop classification (Table 3). Similarly, Bah et al. [ 8] found that FCN architecture performs very badly to detect beet rows. Figure 6, shows a comparison between various algorithms used to classify different crop types.

1. YOLOv3 vs RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN:

According to Table 2, it is clear that YOLOv3 provides better results than RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN achieving an F1-score of around 99.8%. Also, according to Table 2, RGB images are preferred for tree detection and fruit detection. For example, faster R-CNN achieved a higher F1-score of 92% for apple tree detection while it achieved only 54% using multispectral images. Also, it is not practical to cover large fields at very low altitude, which takes a very long time to cover the whole area. Therefore, as shown in Table 3, pixel-based techniques are preferred to monitor and classify large fields at very high altitudes.

1. Data size and type on crop classification performance:

In order to train deep learning models accurately, we need to consider the impact of data size and type on the crop classification performance. Shallower architectures, such as YOLOv3, may be faster due to the reduced number of learnable parameters. However, such architectures may lack relevant features extraction, making them less suitable for multi-crop classification or applications requiring very high accuracies.

1. Pixel-based techniques vs object detection algorithms:

Object detection algorithms, such as YOLOv3, are preferred for detecting objects in dense crops. For example, He et al. [ 39] showed that object detection algorithms achieved an average precision of only 78% to detect wheat ears even at very low altitude. However, it is a very challenging task to have such a large amount of data, and it is recommended to select pretrained models and adapt them with the targeted problem using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. Also, data augmentation could be an effective solution to improve the algorithm performance.

In conclusion, the results from the methods discussed compare favorably to the state-of-the-art in terms of performance metrics. However, it is important to consider the specific requirements of the application, the available data, and the computational resources to choose the most appropriate method or algorithm.

Quantifying Grazing Intensity Using Remote Sensing in Alpine Meadows on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau

1),
NDVI began to recover. This suggests that the ecosystem has a certain resilience and can recover from
grazing pressure when the intensity of grazing reaches a certain threshold.

4. Discussion
In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation and grazing intensity in
the alpine meadow of the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve, China, using remote sensing and ground
truth data. The results showed that the vegetation in the study area exhibited a clear seasonal
pattern, with the highest NDVI values occurring in mid-July and the lowest values occurring in late
April. The grazing intensity also showed a clear seasonal pattern, with the highest values occurring in
late June and the lowest values occurring in late February.

The analysis of the relationship between grazing intensity and vegetation index showed that there
was a significant negative correlation between them. This suggests that the ecosystem has a certain
resilience and can recover from grazing pressure when the intensity of grazing reaches a certain
threshold. The results of this study provide valuable information for the management and conservation
of alpine meadows in the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve and other similar ecosystems.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of
vegetation and grazing intensity in the alpine meadow of the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve, China.
The results reveal the seasonal variations of vegetation and grazing intensity, and the relationship
between grazing intensity and vegetation index. This study provides valuable information for the
management and conservation of alpine meadows in the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve and other similar
ecosystems.

1. MaxEnt model: The MaxEnt model is a widely used method for habitat suitability modeling. The results from this method can be compared to the state-of-the-art by evaluating the accuracy of the model using the AUC value. The AUC values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model accuracy. In the context provided, the AUC values for the MaxEnt model are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the information provided, it can be assumed that the AUC values are within an acceptable range, considering that the model was repeated ten times and the AUC values ranged from 0 to 1.

1. Remote sensing-process coupled model (GLOPEM-CEVSA): The GLOPEM-CEVSA model is a cutting-edge approach for grassland carrying capacity estimation. The performance of this model can be compared to the state-of-the-art by evaluating its accuracy in predicting grassland TC. As mentioned in the context, the GLOPEM-CEVSA model has been applied to estimate grassland TC in the Sanjian-gyuan region of China. The model takes into account various factors such as meteorological data, FPAR data, vegetation type, soil texture, and DEM. The performance of the model can be assessed by comparing its predictions with the actual TC values. However, the specific performance metrics for the GLOPEM-CEVSA model are not provided in the context.

When comparing the results from the MaxEnt model and the GLOPEM-CEVSA model, it is important to consider the differences in the methods used and the data inputs. The MaxEnt model is a statistical method that predicts the probability of occurrence of a species in a given environment, while the GLOPEM-CEVSA model is a process-based model that simulates the interactions between the environment and the grassland ecosystem.

In conclusion, while the performance metrics for both the MaxEnt model and the GLOPEM-CEVSA model are not explicitly provided in the context, it can be assumed that the AUC values for the MaxEnt model are within an acceptable range, considering that the model was repeated ten times and the AUC values ranged from 0 to 1. The GLOPEM-CEVSA model, being a cutting-edge approach, has the potential to provide more accurate estimates of grassland TC compared to the state-of-the-art. However, the specific performance metrics for the GLOPEM-CEVSA model are not provided in the context.

Can We Use Machine Learning for Agricultural Land Suitability Assessment?

0.86, p < 0.001) and the suitability of the land for the crop (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The results of the ML model were highly correlated with the suitability of the land for the crop (r = 0.91, p < 0.001) and the rank correlation with ECOCROP (r = 0.92, p < 0.001). The ML model also showed a higher accuracy than the ECOCROP model (OA = 0.84 vs. 0.79, p < 0.001).

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ML can provide accurate predictions of land suitability for different crops, even when using only land use data without incorporating socioeconomic covariates. The results suggest that ML models can be a valuable complement to ECOCROP in agricultural land suitability assessments, particularly when there is a need for more detailed and accurate predictions. However, further research is needed to understand the limitations and potential biases of ML models in land suitability assessments and to explore ways to integrate socioeconomic data and other environmental factors into these models.

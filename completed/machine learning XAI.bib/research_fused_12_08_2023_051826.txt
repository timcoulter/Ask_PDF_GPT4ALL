Integration of IML and XAI in agricultural decision-making processes: Although IML and XAI have shown promising results in various agricultural applications, their integration into real-world decision-making processes is still limited. Future research should focus on developing practical tools and methods that can be easily adopted by farmers, agronomists, and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

b. Enhancing interpretability and explainability of IML and XAI models: Current IML and XAI models often struggle to provide clear and understandable explanations for their predictions. Future research should aim to improve the interpretability and explainability of these models, making them more accessible and trustworthy for end-users.

c. Addressing the challenges of big data in agriculture: With the increasing availability of data from various sources (e.g., remote sensing, IoT devices, and soil sensors), there is a growing need for IML and XAI techniques that can effectively handle and analyze large-scale agricultural data. Future research should focus on developing novel methods and tools that can effectively leverage big data in agriculture while maintaining interpretability and explainability.

d. Developing IML and XAI techniques for specific agricultural applications: While some IML and XAI techniques have been applied to various agricultural domains (e.g., crop yield prediction, soil management, and pest control), there is still a significant gap in the development of tailored methods and tools for specific agricultural applications. Future research should focus on creating domain-specific IML and XAI solutions that can effectively address the unique challenges and requirements of different agricultural sectors.

e. Enhancing the adaptability and scalability of IML and XAI techniques: As agricultural practices and conditions vary significantly across different regions and farming systems, future research should emphasize the development of adaptable and scalable IML and XAI techniques that can be effectively deployed in diverse agricultural contexts.

f. Ensuring data privacy and security in IML and XAI applications: With the increasing use of data-driven IML and XAI techniques in agriculture, there is a growing concern about data privacy and security. Future research should prioritize the development of methods and tools that ensure the protection of sensitive agricultural data while maintaining the effectiveness of IML and XAI solutions.

In summary, the research gaps and future research directions related to IML and XAI in agriculture involve enhancing the interpretability and explainability of models, addressing the challenges of big data, developing domain-specific solutions, ensuring adaptability and scalability, and prioritizing data privacy and security. By addressing these gaps and directions, researchers can contribute to the development of more effective, trustworthy, and accessible IML and XAI tools for the agricultural sector.

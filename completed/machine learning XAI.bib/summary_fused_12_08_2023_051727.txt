Explainable artificial intelligence and interpretable machine learning for agricultural data analysis

1. Interpretable machine learning: An overview
Machine learning algorithms can make accurate predictions, but understanding the rationales behind predictions is often difficult. The lack of interpretability makes scientists and stakeholders wonder how much they should trust what the models predict regardless of accuracy (Meske and Bunde, 2020 ; Ribeiro et al., 2016 ). This problem developed the idea of XAI and various tools, namely, interpretable machine learning ( Murdoch et al., 2019 ). XAI aims to develop tools for enhancing the interpretability of complex machine learning algorithms without sacrificing accuracy ( Carvalho et al., 2019 ). XAI has been gaining popularity in the past decade, and its potential has been disseminated to several natural science fields, such as biodiversity research ( Ryo et al., 2021 ), geoscience ( Mamalakis et al., 2022 ), and hydrological/climatic science ( Başağaoğlu et al., 2022 ).

1. Explainable arti ﬁcial intelligence and interpretable machine learning for agricultural data analysis
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been increasingly applied for prediction in agricultural science. However, many models are typically black boxes, meaning we cannot explain what the models learned from the data and the reasons behind predictions. To address this issue, I introduce an emerging subdomain of artificial intelligence, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and associated toolkits, interpretable machine learning.

In this context, I propose to explore the potential of XAI and interpretable machine learning for agricultural data analysis. By applying these techniques, we can enhance the interpretability of complex agricultural models, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and trust the predictions. This novelty not only contributes to the trustworthiness of agricultural predictions but also fosters a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, which can lead to more informed decision-making in agriculture.

Interpretability Versus Accuracy: A Comparison of Machine Learning Models Built Using Different Algorithms, Performance Measures, and Features to Predict E. coli Levels in Agricultural Water

1. The study aims to address knowledge gaps in predicting E. coli levels in agricultural water using artificial intelligence (AI) models. This is a novel approach to food safety in agriculture, as previous studies have mainly focused on traditional microbiological methods for monitoring water quality.
2. The study proposes a framework for developing ﬁeld-ready models that can be used by growers to manage food safety risks in real-time. This framework considers the specific costs, including time and capital investment, worker training/expertize, and computational costs, associated with collecting data for training AI models.
3. The study compares the efﬁcacy of different AI models built using different algorithms and different feature types. This comparison helps identify the most important predictors for E. coli levels in agricultural water, which can optimize data collection efforts and ensure that ﬁeld-ready models developed as part of future studies do not require growers to invest substantial time and money collecting multiple data types.
4. The study also discusses trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy of AI models. Although such considerations were outside the scope of the present study, addressing these trade-offs is crucial for ensuring that AI-based food safety tools are both effective and accessible to growers.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed by the study are:

Explainable artificial intelligence and interpretable machine learning for agricultural data analysis



First, let's clarify the methods discussed in the context:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forests
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Interpretable Machine Learning Methods (Permutation-based Variable Importance, Pairwise Interpretation, and Local Interpretation)

Now, let's compare the performance metrics of these methods:

1. Decision Tree:
RMSE: 0.01
R 

2. Random Forests:
RMSE: 0.01
R 

3. Gradient Boosting:
RMSE: 0.01
R 

4. Interpretable Machine Learning Methods:
Permutation-based Variable Importance: The method provides a ranking of variables based on their importance in the model. However, it does not provide any direct insight into the model's decision-making process.

Pairwise Interpretation: This method helps in understanding the relationship between two variables. However, it does not provide any direct insight into the model's decision-making process.

Local Interpretation: This method focuses on a specific region of the input space and provides insights into the model's decision-making process in that region. However, it does not provide any global understanding of the model's behavior.

Comparing the performance metrics of the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers) with the discussed methods, we can see that the discussed methods have similar performance in terms of RMSE. However, the discussed methods lack the global understanding and direct insight into the model's decision-making process that deep learning models often provide.

In conclusion, the discussed methods (decision tree, random forests, gradient boosting, and interpretable machine learning methods) have comparable performance in terms of RMSE. However, they do not provide the same level of global understanding and direct insight into the model's decision-making process that deep learning models often provide.

In summary, the top-performing models discussed here, built using boosted or bagged algorithms, have RMSE values that are competitive with other state-of-the-art models. However, it is important to note that the performance metrics used in this study (RMSE, Kendall's Tau, and R2) may not be the most appropriate for assessing the accuracy and interpretability of the models. Future studies should consider using performance metrics that better capture the trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy, such as the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) (Ribeiro et al., 2016 ) or Shapley Additive Explanations (Sage et al., 2018 ).

Evaluation of the factors explaining the use of agricultural land: A machine learning and model-agnostic approach



First, let's clarify the methods discussed in the context:

1. VIF: This method is used to identify and remove highly correlated variables from the initial set of variables. The VIF values are calculated for each cropland individually, and the final number of included variables is 42 for wheat, 25 for maize, and 44 for olive groves (see Table A2 in the Appendix).
2. RF algorithm: This is a machine learning algorithm that has been demonstrated to exhibit very similar performance or perform better than other ML algorithms (Al-Fugara et al., 2020; Li et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2016). The RF algorithm has been described as robust in terms of fitting capacity during training and validation procedures, even with a small number of sample points (Luan et al., 2020; Moghaddam et al., 2019).

Now let's compare the results from these methods to the state-of-the-art in the field of agricultural land-use systems modeling:

1. State-of-the-art models often use multiple regression, which can be sensitive to multicollinearity and may not capture nonlinear relationships. In contrast, the VIF method helps to identify and remove highly correlated variables, reducing the risk of multicollinearity and improving the accuracy of the model.
2. Machine learning algorithms, such as the RF algorithm, have been shown to achieve superior or at least equivalent accuracy outcomes compared to traditional methods (Molnar, 2019). The RF algorithm is non-sensitive to the scale of variables, allowing for the exploitation and combination of different data resources to model complex nonlinear relationships that describe agricultural land-use systems.

In summary, the results from the methods discussed in the context compare favorably to the state-of-the-art in agricultural land-use systems modeling. The VIF method helps to identify and remove highly correlated variables, reducing the risk of multicollinearity and improving the accuracy of the model. The RF algorithm, being non-sensitive to the scale of variables, allows for the exploitation and combination of different data resources to model complex nonlinear relationships that describe agricultural land-use systems.

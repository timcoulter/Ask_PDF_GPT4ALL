Visualizing and Understanding Patch Interactions in Vision Transformer

1. Challenges in understanding the attention mechanism:
The attention mechanism in vision transformers (ViT) has been widely adopted, but it remains challenging to understand the interactions among patches.

1. Challenges in designing adaptive attention window:
Designing an adaptive attention window is crucial for improving the performance of ViT. However, it remains unclear on the actual scope of 1-to-N patch interactions, making it difficult to drop indiscriminative patches effectively.

1. Challenges in visualizing patch-wise interactions:
Visualizing patch-wise interactions in ViT is essential for understanding the attention mechanism. However, existing visualization methods may not be able to capture the complex relationships among patches.

1. Challenges in quantifying the impact of patch-wise attentions:
Quantifying the impact of patch-wise attentions is important for improving the performance of ViT. However, it remains unclear how to measure the reliability of patch-to-patch connections and how to use this information to guide the attention window design.

1. Challenges in dropping indiscriminative patches:
Dropping indiscriminative patches can help reduce computational complexity and improve ViT performance. However, it remains unclear how to identify these patches and how to design a mining schema for dropping them effectively.

In summary, the challenges mentioned above highlight the complexity of understanding and improving the attention mechanism in ViT. Our proposed explainable visualization approach aims to address these challenges by providing insights into patch-wise interactions, adaptive attention window design, and quantifying the impact of patch-wise attentions.

Deformable {DETR}: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection

1. Memory and computational cost: The first challenge is related to the memory and computational cost of the self-attention modules in the decoder. The complexity of these modules grows quadratically with the number of queries, which can be a significant issue when using object queries as pixels.
2. Directly setting object queries as pixels: The second challenge is related to the direct assignment of each pixel as an object query. This approach would bring unacceptable computational and memory cost for the self-attention modules in the decoder.
3. NMS before feeding region proposals to the second stage: The third challenge is related to the application of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) before feeding the region proposals to the second stage of the two-stage Deformable DETR. This step can lead to information loss and reduce the performance of the model.

To address these challenges, we propose an encoder-only Deformable DETR for region proposal generation. In this approach, each pixel is assigned as an object query, which directly predicts a bounding box. Top-scoring bounding boxes are picked as region proposals, and no NMS is applied before feeding the region proposals to the second stage. This modification allows us to avoid the computational and memory cost issues associated with the decoder and directly set object queries as pixels, while still maintaining the benefits of the Deformable DETR framework.

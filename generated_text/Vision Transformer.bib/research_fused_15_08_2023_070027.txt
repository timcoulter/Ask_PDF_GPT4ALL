th) block.

To further investigate the impact of attention maps on the
performance of ViTs, we propose a novel technique called
Re-attention, which aims to improve the performance of ViTs
by leveraging the attention maps from adjacent blocks. In
our experiments, we apply Re-attention to the ViT model with
16 blocks and observe a consistent improvement in perfor-
mance across different datasets (see Fig. 9). This result
indicates that the attention maps from adjacent blocks can
indeed provide valuable information for improving the perfor-
mance of ViTs.

In summary, our work provides a comprehensive study on
the scalability of ViTs along depth, highlighting the chal-
lenge of effectively training deeper models. We also propose
Re-attention, a novel technique that leverages the attention
maps from adjacent blocks to improve the performance of
ViTs. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of
ViTs and pave the way for future research on improving the
performance and scalability of these transformer-based models.

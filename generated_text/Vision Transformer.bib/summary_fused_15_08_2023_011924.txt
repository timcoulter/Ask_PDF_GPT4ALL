Training data-efficient image transformers \& distillation through attention

1. The paper proposes a simple and elegant architecture called "Transformer-based CNN" (T-CNN) that processes an input image as if it were a sequence of input tokens.
2. The input RGB image is decomposed into a batch of Npatches of a fixed size of 16x16 pixels (N=14x14). Each patch is projected with a linear layer that conserves its overall dimension of 3x16x16=768.
3. The transformer block described above is invariant to the order of the patch embeddings, and thus ignores their positions. The positional information is incorporated as fixed (Vaswani et al., 2017) or trainable (Gehring et al., 2017) positional embeddings. They are added before the first transformer block to the patch tokens, which are then fed to the stack of transformer blocks.
4. The class token is a trainable vector, appended to the patch tokens before the first layer, that goes through the transformer layers and is then projected with a linear layer to predict the class. This class token is inherited from NLP (Devlin et al., 2018) and departs from the typical CNN architecture.

Main ideas and novelty proposed:

1. The paper proposes a novel architecture, T-CNN, that combines the strengths of both CNNs and transformers.
2. The T-CNN architecture processes an input image as a sequence of patch embeddings, enabling the model to learn hierarchical representations of the input image.

4. The class token is a trainable vector that goes through the transformer layers, enabling the model to learn more discriminative features for classification tasks.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed by the paper are:

1. Combining the strengths of CNNs and transformers.
2. Processing an input image as a sequence of patch embeddings.

{CrossViT}: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification

1. All-attention fusion: This method bundles all tokens together without considering any characteristics of tokens. The main idea is to combine the information from different scales and branches, but it does not take into account the interactions between tokens, which could be beneficial for feature fusion.
2. Class token fusion: This method fuses only CLS tokens as they can be considered as global representations of one branch. The novelty here is to use the CLS tokens as a means to communicate information between branches. However, this method does not consider the interactions between CLS tokens and other tokens within a branch.
3. Pairwise fusion: This method fuses tokens at the corresponding spatial locations together and CLS tokens separately. The novelty here is to consider the spatial relationships between tokens within a branch. However, this method does not take into account the interactions between CLS tokens and other tokens within a branch.

Now let's discuss the proposed cross-attention module. The main idea is to introduce a new way of fusing multi-scale features by considering the interactions between tokens from different branches. The novelty here is to use the CLS tokens as a means to communicate information between branches and to leverage the spatial relationships between tokens within a branch.

In summary, the proposed cross-attention module introduces a new way of fusing multi-scale features by considering the interactions between tokens from different branches and leveraging the spatial relationships between tokens within a branch. This method provides a more effective and efficient way of fusing multi-scale features compared to the other fusion schemes mentioned.

{CrossViT}: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification

1. All-attention fusion: This method bundles all tokens together without considering any characteristics of tokens. The main idea is to combine the information from different scales and branches, but it does not take into account the interactions between tokens, which could be beneficial for feature fusion.
2. Class token fusion: This method fuses only CLS tokens as they can be considered as global representations of one branch. The novelty here is to use the CLS tokens as a means to communicate information between branches. However, this method does not consider the interactions between CLS tokens and other tokens within a branch.
3. Pairwise fusion: This method fuses tokens at the corresponding spatial locations together and CLS tokens separately. The novelty here is to consider the spatial relationships between tokens within a branch. However, this method does not take into account the interactions between CLS tokens and other tokens within a branch.

Now let's discuss the proposed cross-attention module. The main idea is to introduce a new way of fusing multi-scale features by considering the interactions between tokens from different branches. The novelty here is to use the CLS tokens as a means to communicate information between branches and to leverage the spatial relationships between tokens within a branch.

In summary, the proposed cross-attention module introduces a new way of fusing multi-scale features by considering the interactions between tokens from different branches and leveraging the spatial relationships between tokens within a branch. This method provides a more effective and efficient way of fusing multi-scale features compared to the other fusion schemes mentioned.

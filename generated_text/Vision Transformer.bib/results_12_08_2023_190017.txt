Deformable {DETR}: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection



1. Deformable DETR: The method achieves 48.7 AP on COCO 2017 val set without bells and whistles. This result is competitive with the state-of-the-art, such as CRAFT (Cao et al., 2020) and DETR (Carion et al., 2020), which report 49.1 and 50.1 AP, respectively.
2. Deformable DETR + iterative bounding box reﬁnement: This method further improves the performance to 49.0 AP, surpassing the state-of-the-art results.
3. Deformable DETR + two-stage training: This method achieves 50.1 AP, which is the state-of-the-art performance on COCO 2017 val set.

Now let's compare the performance metrics of these methods:

1. Deformable DETR: 48.7 AP
2. Deformable DETR + iterative bounding box reﬁnement: 49.0 AP
3. Deformable DETR + two-stage training: 50.1 AP

As we can see, the performance metrics of these methods are consistently improving as we progress through the methods. The state-of-the-art performance is achieved by Deformable DETR + two-stage training with 50.1 AP.

In summary, the proposed method, Deformable DETR + two-stage training, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on COCO 2017 val set with 50.1 AP. The method demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating deformable attention mechanisms into the DETR framework for object detection.

{TransMix}: Attend to Mix for Vision Transformers



1. Baseline (DeiT-S w/o CutMix): The baseline performance is 78.6% top1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k.
2. CutMix: CutMix improves the baseline performance by 1.2% to 79.8% top1 accuracy.
3. Attentive-CutMix: Although Attentive-CutMix reduces the performance by 1.1% compared to the baseline, it still achieves 77.5% top1 accuracy.
4. SaliencyMix: SaliencyMix shows a marginal improvement of 0.6% over the baseline, resulting in 79.2% top1 accuracy.
5. Puzzle-Mix: Puzzle-Mix provides a slight improvement of 0.6% compared to the baseline, leading to 79.8% top1 accuracy.
6. TransMix: TransMix demonstrates the most significant improvement of 2.1% compared to the baseline, achieving 80.7% top1 accuracy.

Comparing the performance metrics of these methods with the state-of-the-art, we can see that TransMix outperforms all other methods, including CutMix, Attentive-CutMix, SaliencyMix, and Puzzle-Mix. The improvements provided by these mixup variants are generally smaller than the gain achieved by TransMix.

In summary, the results from the methods discussed in this paper are competitive with the state-of-the-art. TransMix demonstrates the most significant improvement, outperforming all other mixup variants. However, it is important to note that these results are based on a preliminary study, and further research is needed to fully understand the generalizability of TransMix and its potential impact on vision transformer models.

{BEIT}: {BERT} Pre-Training of Image Transformers



1. Compared with the models trained by random initialization, we find that pre-trained BEIT significantly improves performance on both datasets. Notably, on the smaller CIFAR-100 dataset, ViT trained from scratch only reaches 48:5% accuracy (Chen et al., 2021). In comparison, BEIT achieves 90:1% with the help of pre-training. The results indicate that BEIT can greatly reduce the requirement of annotation efforts. BEIT also improves the performance on ImageNet, which shows the effectiveness under the rich-resource setting.

1. Among the compared methods, iGPT-1.36B (Chen et al., 2020a) uses much more parameters (i.e., 1:36B vs 86M), and ViT-JFT300M (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) is pretrained on larger corpus (i.e., 300M vs 1:3M), while others pretrain ViT-Base on ImageNet-1K. iGPT-1.36B and ViT-JFT300M are the most comparable methods, which also follows auto-encoding pre-training for vision Transformer. Speciﬁcally, iGPT uses clustered image tokens as both input and output for image GPT or image BERT. In contrast, we use image patches as input to preserve raw pixels, and employ discrete visual tokens as a prediction bottleneck. ViT-JFT300 predicts the mean, 3-bit color of each masked patch, rather than visual tokens learned by discrete V AE. Moreover, BEIT outperforms DINO (Caron et al., 2021) on ImageNet, and MoCo v3 on CIFAR-100, respectively. We can see that BEIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, surpassing previous methods.

In summary, BEIT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method for image classiﬁcation tasks.

Recent Advances in Vision Transformer: A Survey and Outlook of Recent Work



1. Pure ViT: Pure ViT models like DeiT, T2T-ViT, and Visformer have shown promising results in terms of performance. However, they still lack shared weights, local context, and receptive fields compared to CNNs.
2. Combination of CNN and ViT: Studies have shown that combining CNN and ViT leads to better performance than using pure ViTs. This is because CNNs provide local features, while ViTs capture long-range relationships.

Comparing the results from the methods discussed with the state-of-the-art, we can see that ViT-based models have surpassed CNN-based methods in terms of performance on various benchmark datasets. For example, the ViT model achieved 81.6 points on the ImageNet dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art result.

When comparing performance metrics, ViT-based models generally outperform CNN-based methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and other relevant metrics. However, CNN-based methods often have lower computational costs and require fewer parameters, making them more suitable for resource-constrained devices.

In summary, ViT-based models have shown significant improvements in performance compared to CNN-based methods. While ViT-based models may have higher computational costs and require more parameters, they provide better long-range relationship modeling capabilities. The choice between ViT-based and CNN-based methods largely depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand, such as computational resources, model complexity, and desired trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

Vision Transformers are Robust Learners



First, let's discuss the results from the methods discussed in the paper. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of ViTs and BiTs under similar parameter and FLOP regimes, pre-training setups, and data regimes. The authors perform a series of experiments to verify the enhanced robustness of ViTs and to explain the reasons behind their improved performance.

Now, let's compare the performance metrics of ViTs and BiTs with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs. The SOTA CNNs are typically based on ResNet-50 (He et al. 2016) or EfficientNet (Tan et al. 2019).

1. Robustness under similar parameter and FLOP regimes:
ViTs show improved robustness compared to BiTs and SOTA CNNs under similar parameter and FLOP regimes. For example, ViTs achieve a top-1 accuracy of 28.10% on ImageNet-A, which is 4.3x higher than a comparable variant of BiT. This demonstrates the superior robustness of ViTs compared to BiTs and SOTA CNNs.

1. Pre-training setup:
ViTs and BiTs share similar pre-training schedules and dataset regimes, such as using larger datasets like ImageNet-21k (Deng et al. 2009) and JFT-300 (Sun et al. 2017), longer pre-training schedules, and so on. This shared setup allows for a fair comparison between ViTs and BiTs.

1. Data regimes:
Both ViTs and BiTs are designed to work with large-scale datasets, which helps them achieve better performance compared to SOTA CNNs. The shared data regime between ViTs and BiTs ensures a fair comparison between the two models.

In summary, the results from the methods discussed in the paper show that ViTs outperform BiTs and SOTA CNNs in terms of robustness under similar parameter and FLOP regimes, pre-training setups, and data regimes. The performance metrics of ViTs are significantly better than those of BiTs and SOTA CNNs, demonstrating the enhanced robustness of ViTs.

1. Early concatenation based multimodal interaction:
The performance of this method depends on the quality of the individual modalities. If the modalities are well-trained and of high quality, the early concatenation method can achieve competitive results compared to state-of-the-art multimodal models. However, if the modalities are of low quality or not well-trained, the performance may be suboptimal.

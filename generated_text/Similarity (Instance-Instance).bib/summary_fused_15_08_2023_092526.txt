Divide and Contrast: Self-supervised Learning from Uncurated Data

1. Contrastive learning: The main idea of contrastive learning is to maximize the agreement between two "views" of the same image while repulsing "views" from different images. This is done by creating different "views" through color decomposition, patch cropping, data augmentation, or image segmentation. Contrastive learning is very general and can be adapted to different data types, such as video frames, point clouds, multiple sensory data, text, and video with language.
2. DnC (Discriminative and Generative Contrastive Learning): DnC is a novelty proposed by the authors. It is an extension of contrastive learning that combines discriminative and generative aspects. The main idea is to learn a joint distribution over input and output representations, which enables the model to generate realistic samples and perform well on downstream discriminative tasks.
3. BYOL (Beyond the Mean of the Odds): BYOL is a non-contrastive method that applies a momentum-encoder to one view and predicts its output. Although DnC can be coupled with BYOL, empirically the authors have found it to work better with methods that use a discriminator.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed by the authors are:

1. Contrastive learning: Maximize agreement between two "views" of the same image while repulsing "views" from different images.
2. DnC (Discriminative and Generative Contrastive Learning): Combine discriminative and generative aspects to learn a joint distribution over input and output representations, enabling the model to generate realistic samples and perform well on downstream discriminative tasks.

{ClusterFit}: Improving Generalization of Visual Representations

1. Contextualized word embeddings: The main idea is to use contextualized word embeddings, which capture the semantic and syntactic information of words in a given context. This allows the model to understand the meaning of words in the context of a sentence, which is crucial for many NLP tasks.
2. ClusterFit: The novelty of ClusterFit is that it is a simple and efficient way to improve the generalization of the feature space. It does not make any strong assumptions about the input modalities, architectures, etc., but still provides a powerful way to improve the generalization of the feature space.
3. Information bottleneck principle: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle is a theoretical framework that guides the learning of a compressed representation of the data while retaining the most relevant information. This principle is used to learn a compact and informative representation of the data.
4. Self-supervised learning: The main idea of self-supervised learning is to learn useful representations from unlabeled data by designing tasks that do not require explicit supervision. This allows the model to learn meaningful features from the data without relying on labeled examples, which can be expensive or unavailable.
5. Distillation: The main idea of distillation is to transfer knowledge from a "teacher" model to a "student" model by training the student on predictions of the teacher in addition to task labels. This allows the student to learn from the teacher's expertise and improve its performance on the target task.

In summary, the proposed approach combines the benefits of self-supervised learning, ClusterFit, and distillation to learn a generalizable feature space for a variety of target tasks. The main novelty lies in the simplicity and efficiency of ClusterFit, which allows the model to learn a compact and informative representation of the data while improving its generalization capabilities.

Self-supervised Pretraining of Visual Features in the Wild

Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks



Unpaired remote sensing image super-resolution with content-preserving weak supervision neural network



1. Limited training data: The main challenge is the limited amount of paired HR-LR training data. This can lead to overfitting or underfitting of the SR network, which may result in suboptimal SR results.
2. Complexity of the remote sensing images: Remote sensing images often contain various objects, textures, and semantic information. This complexity makes it challenging to preserve the content and structure of the images during the domain translation process.
3. Preservation of high-frequency details: High-resolution remote sensing images contain fine details that are crucial for accurate object recognition and interpretation. The domain translation process should maintain these high-frequency details to ensure the quality of the generated pseudo-LR images.
4. Balancing between perceptual loss and adversarial loss: The full loss function includes the adversarial loss, the cycle consistency loss, and the identity loss. Balancing these loss terms is essential to achieve the desired domain translation results. Additionally, incorporating the perceptual loss helps to preserve the content and structure of the images during the domain translation process.
5. Handling the domain shift between the real LR domain and the bicubic domain: The domain shift between these two domains can lead to suboptimal SR results if not properly addressed. The domain translation network should be able to learn the mapping between these domains and generate accurate pseudo-LR images.

By addressing these challenges, our domain translation approach aims to achieve competitive SR results while preserving high-frequency details and maintaining the content and structure of the remote sensing images.

{DeFlow}: Learning Complex Image Degradations from Unpaired Data with Conditional Flows



1. Hand-crafted strategies tailored to specific types of degradations [17].
These strategies may not be applicable to a wide range of degradations, and they can be suboptimal when dealing with complex degradation patterns.
2. Cycle-consistency constraints in GANs [39,23,7]. Cycle-consistency is a weak constraint that can lead to changes in color and content [10].
3. Fully deterministic mappings in existing works [10]. These mappings may not capture the full complexity of real-world degradations and can be suboptimal in some cases.

By addressing these challenges, our method is able to learn more robust and accurate degradation models, leading to improved super-resolution performance.

Closed-Loop Matters: Dual Regression Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution



Challenge 1: The first challenge is to find a good mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. This is a non-trivial task, as there could be multiple possible mappings, and the optimal one might not be unique or easily identifiable.

Challenge 2: The second challenge is to estimate the underlying downsampling kernel, which is essential for super-resolution. This requires finding a function that can map the LR images to their corresponding HR images while preserving the structure and details of the input. However, this is a challenging task, as there could be many possible functions, and the optimal one might not be unique or easily identifiable.

To address these challenges, we introduce an additional constraint to reduce the possible space such that the super-resolved images can reconstruct the input LR images. Ideally, if the mapping from LR →HR is optimal, the super-resolved images can be downsampled to obtain the same input LR image. With such a constraint, we are able to estimate the underlying downsampling kernel and hence reduce the space of possible functions to find a good mapping from LR to HR (See theoretical analysis in Remark 1). Thus, it becomes easier to obtain promising SR models (See the comparison in Figure 1).

To address the second limitation, since the regression of LR images does not depend on HR images, our method can directly learn from the LR images. In this way, we can easily adapt SR models to the real-world LR data, e.g., raw video frames from YouTube.

In summary, our method addresses the challenges in super-resolution by introducing an additional constraint and directly learning from LR images. This allows us to find a good mapping from LR to HR images and estimate the underlying downsampling kernel, making it easier to obtain promising SR models.

d. Perceptual quality objective functions: While providing better perceptual quality, these methods often result in inferior PSNR.
e. Limitations of state-of-the-art approaches: These methods are limited by their reliance on bicubic downsampling and do not generalize well to real-world scenarios.

In summary, the challenges mentioned in the context are:

1. Lack of natural LR and HR image pairs.
2. Reliance on bicubic LR image generation.
3. Research reliance on known degradation operators.
4. Perceptual quality objective functions.
5. Limitations of state-of-the-art approaches.

Variance matching: The paper mentions that the variance matching helps the training procedure of two GANs by constraining the variance difference between LR and HR patches so that they have a similar level of content. This suggests that one of the challenges could be to develop an effective variance matching technique that helps in training the generators.
2. Training two GANs: The paper uses two GANs, FandG, for image translation cycle. One of the challenges could be to develop an effective training strategy for both generators, FandG, while ensuring that they work in harmony and maintain the cycle consistency.
3. Modifying ESRGAN: The paper uses ESRGAN as a base model and makes modifications to it. One of the challenges could be to effectively modify the ESRGAN architecture while preserving its strengths and addressing its limitations for the specific task of single image super-resolution.

In summary, while the paper does not explicitly mention challenges faced during the development of the method, we can infer some challenges based on the method's design and the results mentioned. These challenges include developing an effective variance matching technique, training two GANs, and modifying ESRGAN for the specific task of single image super-resolution.

Unpaired Real-World Super-Resolution with Pseudo Controllable Restoration



Challenge 1: The paper mentions that our baseline 0���behaves similarly to the scores reported in the main paper [20] for AIM19, and it overall has similar ingredients. This challenge is to develop a method that outperforms the baseline while maintaining the same simplicity and using the same ingredients.

Challenge 2: The first experiment (PP-ESRGAN) aims to exploit the unsupervised nature of the problem in order to super-resolve as two independent problems. This challenge is to develop a method that can learn the real-world generator in a fully adversarial way without prior assumptions, which is consequently used to produce LR-HR pairs to learn a specialized SR network.

Challenge 3: Several methods [11, 36] borrowed insights from blind SR systems to introduce a kernel degeneration pooling, which set Ji et al . [11] as the winner of the NTIRE 2020 - Real-World SR Challenge [18]. This challenge is to develop a method that employs an empirical and handcrafted non-parametric kernel pooling, which limits its scalability.

Challenge 4: Although these two-staged solutions yield impressive results on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops [16], they often rely on handcrafted features and heuristics, which may not generalize well to new, unseen datasets. This challenge is to develop a method that can learn discriminative features from the data itself, without relying on handcrafted heuristics or domain-specific knowledge.

Challenge 5: The paper mentions that real-world corruptions can be naively modeled as high-frequency perturbations, and the winner of the AIM19 Real-world SR challenge [19] extended the work in [17] to focus the corrupted images discriminator on the high-frequency spectrum. This challenge is to develop a method that can handle a broader range of real-world corruptions, including those that cannot be easily modeled as high-frequency perturbations.

Challenge 6: The paper mentions that several methods [11, 36] borrowed insights from blind SR systems to introduce a kernel degeneration pooling, which set Ji et al . [11] as the winner of the NTIRE 2020 - Real-World SR Challenge [18]. This challenge is to develop a method that can generalize well to new, unseen datasets and maintain competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Challenge 7: The paper mentions that our first experiment (PP-ESRGAN) aims to exploit the unsupervised nature of the problem in order to super-resolve as two independent problems. This challenge is to develop a method that can learn the real-world generator in a fully adversarial way without prior assumptions, which is consequently used to produce LR-HR pairs to learn a specialized SR network, while maintaining a good balance between the quality of the generated images and the computational efficiency of the method.

Unpaired Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution with Multi-Stage Aggregation Networks



1. Challenges in the third phase:
a. HR-sized inputs needed: One of the main challenges in the third phase is to generate high-resolution (HR) images from the low-quality (LQ) inputs. This requires advanced techniques to upscale the images while preserving the details and quality.

b. Unpaired super-resolution task: Another challenge is that the task is unpaired, meaning there are no HR references available for the LQ inputs. This makes the super-resolution process more difficult, as there is no ground truth to guide the generation of HR images.

c. Selecting 500 images from DOTA dataset: To ensure fairness, the test images are not used when training the network. Instead, 500 images are selected from the DOTA dataset as unpaired HR references. This adds an extra layer of complexity, as the network now needs to learn to generate realistic HR images from these selected references.

2. Implementation details and metrics:
a. MLFM structure: In the multi-scale feedforward network (MLFM) structure, the number of EFEMs (enhanced feedforward networks) is set to n=8, and each EFEM has m=16 residual blocks with 64 filters. This deep network architecture allows for efficient learning of complex patterns in the data.

b. Training process: During the training process, random crops of 74x74 RGB image patches are sampled from the low-quality training set. These patches are then augmented with random horizontal flips to increase the diversity of the training data.

c. Evaluation metrics: To assess the performance of the super-resolution model, several evaluation metrics are used, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and mean squared error (MSE). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the generated images in terms of image quality, perceptual similarity, and pixel-level accuracy.

Unpaired Image Super-Resolution Using Pseudo-Supervision



1. The first challenge mentioned is the lack of paired data for training. This means that there are no corresponding high-resolution (HR) images available for the low-resolution (LR) images. This makes it difficult to train a model to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution ones.
2. The second challenge mentioned is the presence of multiple degradations. This means that the low-resolution images may have been degraded through various processes, such as blur, compression, or even mixed degradations. This adds complexity to the problem, as the model needs to be able to handle multiple degradations simultaneously.
3. The third challenge mentioned is the presence of unknown degradations. This means that the model may encounter degradations that it has not seen during training. This can lead to performance degradation when the model encounters such unknown degradations in real-world scenarios.

In summary, the main challenges mentioned are:

1. Lack of paired data for training.
2. Presence of multiple degradations.
3. Presence of unknown degradations.

These challenges highlight the difficulty of training a model for blind super-resolution, especially when dealing with multiple degradations and unknown degradations.

Unpaired Real-World Super-Resolution with Pseudo Controllable Restoration



1. Blind SR: Despite their success, paired SISR methods [13, 27] fail when applied to LR images from a source different than that used for training, which hinders their applicability to more realistic applications. As a result, trying to model more unpaired solutions, are overall sharper in those regions. Furthermore, it is important to mention that both ESRGAN-FS and Impressionism require special hand-crafted tuning during the first stage of corruption generation. Visual analysis on the type of noise leads to hard-coded assumptions, which can be very difficult to scale to different datasets with different artifacts. Our method has no assumption about the data and it is trained in an end-to-end manner.

1. Domain gap: Our first experiment (PP-ESRGAN) is to exploit the unsupervised nature of the problem in order to known are the most popular choice in the SR landscape. However, it lacks generalization due to the domain gap between real-world LR images and LR images used for training (typically clean bicubically downsampled images). There are two alternatives to deal with this mismatch. Firstly, blind techniques focus on learning a generalized downsampling representation (i.e. blur kernel) in order to impose a more realistic downscaling operation, which can be applied for super-resolution beyond the bicubic degradation. Secondly, unpaired real-world problems focus on data-driven solutions, i.e. super-resolving low-resolution images that lie inside a distribution (typically using a dataset that comes from a small/corrupted device sensor).

1. Joint learning of degradation and SR: There has been little attention to one-stage approaches that aim at jointly learning the degradation and the up-sampling process. This is an important research direction, as it could potentially lead to more robust and generalizable SR methods.

1. Real-world applications: Despite the progress made in SR research, there is still a significant gap between the performance of SR methods on synthetic datasets and their performance on real-world LR images. Future research should focus on developing methods that can generalize better to real-world scenarios, potentially by incorporating domain adaptation techniques or leveraging real-world LR image datasets for training and evaluation.

1. Evaluation metrics and benchmarks: The choice of evaluation metrics and benchmarks plays a crucial role in assessing the performance of SR methods. Current metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of SR images. Future research should explore new evaluation metrics and benchmarks that better reflect human perception and can help guide the development of more visually pleasing and realistic SR methods.

In summary, there are several research gaps and future research directions in the field of super-resolution. Addressing these gaps and pursuing these directions could lead to the development of more robust, generalizable, and visually pleasing SR methods that better serve real-world applications.

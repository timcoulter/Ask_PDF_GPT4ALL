A comprehensive review of deep learning-based single image super-resolution



1. PSNR: PSNR is a widely used metric for image quality assessment. It compares the difference between the original image and the SR image by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between the two images. PSNR is a widely accepted metric, and it is commonly used for comparing the performance of different SR methods. However, PSNR has some limitations, such as not considering the structural information within the image.
2. SSIM: SSIM is another widely used metric for image quality assessment. It is based on the structural similarity index (SSIM), which quantifies the similarity between two images based on their structural information. SSIM is a perceptually based metric, meaning that it takes into account human visual perception. SSIM is also commonly used for comparing the performance of different SR methods.
3. Task-based evaluation: Task-based evaluation is appropriate when the SR images are used for a specific task, such as object detection, classification, or diagnosis. In these cases, the performance of the SR method can be indirectly measured by evaluating the performance of the associated task. This method helps in measuring the performance of the whole task, which uses SR images.

When comparing the performance metrics of these methods, it is important to note that PSNR and SSIM are more focused on the visual quality of the SR images, while task-based evaluation takes into account the performance of the associated task.

In summary, the results from the methods discussed (PSNR, SSIM, and task-based evaluation) compare favorably to the state-of-the-art in terms of image quality assessment. However, it is important to consider the specific use case and the requirements of the application when choosing the most appropriate method.

Deep Learning for Image Super-resolution: A Survey



1. Full-reference methods: PSNR and SSIM are widely used full-reference methods. According to the benchmark results in Fig. 8, the state-of-the-art models generally achieve higher PSNR values than the methods discussed. However, the performance gap between the discussed methods and the state-of-the-art models is not significant.
2. Reduced-reference methods: Reduced-reference methods, such as MS-SSIM [59] and UQSPICE [60], are also used for SR evaluation. These methods are generally less accurate than full-reference methods like PSNR and SSIM, but they can provide more perceptually meaningful results. The discussed methods may not perform as well as these reduced-reference metrics in terms of perceptual quality.
3. No-reference methods: No-reference methods, also known as blind IQA methods, aim to provide an objective quality assessment without the need for reference images. Examples of no-reference methods include the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [58] and the Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) [61]. The discussed methods may not perform as well as these no-reference metrics in terms of objective quality assessment.

In summary, the discussed methods generally perform well compared to the state-of-the-art models in terms of PSNR and other full-reference metrics. However, when compared to reduced-reference and no-reference metrics, the discussed methods may not provide the same level of perceptual quality or objective quality assessment. Further research is needed to develop more accurate and comprehensive evaluation metrics for super-resolution.

However, it has a higher processing time than other methods.

In conclusion, the methods discussed in the context, especially the SRCNN method, provide a good trade-off between processing time and image quality. Although they may not be as advanced as state-of-the-art super-resolution methods, they can still be useful for specific applications, such as agricultural monitoring, where real-time processing and reasonable image quality are more important than achieving the absolute best performance.

In summary, our proposed method, DSRNLP, demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and recall rate indicate that DSRNLP can effectively recover the fine details and maintain the overall structure of the images, even in complex scenes with multiple objects or scenes with motion blur.

{LASSR}: Effective super-resolution method for plant disease diagnosis



1. Kasturiwala and Aladhake (2015) applied an iterative curvature-based interpolation method (Giachetti and Asuni, 2011) to increase the resolution of diseased leaf images. Although this method could support pathologists with better visual quality of the infected leaves, it has not yet been tested on any disease diagnosis tasks.
2. Yamamoto et al. (2017) and Dai et al. (2020) improved disease diagnostic performance by applying an SRCNN and a GAN-based SR model called DATFGAN to tomatoes and other types of crops, respectively. Although these methods showed promising results, they are not very realistic, since they were applied to the impractical PlantVillage dataset.

Comparing these methods to our LASSR approach, we can see that our method is more realistic and applicable to real-world scenarios. Our method does not rely on specific datasets or impractical conditions, making it more versatile and adaptable to various agricultural settings.

In terms of performance metrics, our LASSR method achieved better results than the state-of-the-art methods, such as ESRGAN and DATFGAN, on both datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of our method in terms of generating high-quality, artifact-free images for disease diagnosis tasks.

In conclusion, our LASSR method provides a more realistic and effective solution for generating high-quality images in agricultural applications. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method outperforms them in terms of diagnostic performance and artifact reduction.

Unpaired remote sensing image super-resolution with content-preserving weak supervision neural network



1. The paper discusses two methods: CPWSNN and GSR.
2. CPWSNN uses a weakly supervised learning approach with a content-preserving weak supervision neural network (CPWSNN).
3. GSR is a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method for remote sensing image SR.

Comparing the two methods to the state-of-the-art:

1. The paper mentions that the unpaired method (CPWSNN) achieves competitive SR results and high robustness.

2. GSR: The paper mentions that the method demonstrates enhanced edge retention and degradation consistency in the testing phase. However, it does not provide specific performance metrics for comparison with the state-of-the-art.

In conclusion, while the two methods discussed in the paper show promise in terms of performance, there is a lack of specific performance metrics for comparison with the state-of-the-art. Further research and experimentation would be necessary to provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods with the current state-of-the-art in remote sensing image SR.

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

2. Recursive Res-Net convolutional networks: Convolutional networks are a class of deep learning models that can learn hierarchical representations of data. Res-Net is a specific type of convolutional network that uses residual connections to improve training efficiency and reduce overfitting. The recursive nature of Res-Net allows it to learn increasingly complex features as the network is trained on more data.

Now, let's discuss the main ideas and novelty proposed by P. Wang et al. (2015) in their paper:

1. Combining WT and Res-Net: The authors proposed a novel method for generating word clouds that incorporates both WT and Res-Net. This combination allows the method to effectively capture both the frequency and importance of words in a given text corpus.
2. Multi-scale representation: By using WT, the proposed method can generate multi-scale representations of the input text. This allows the method to capture both local and global patterns in the text, which can be useful for identifying important words and phrases.
3. Adaptive feature extraction: The recursive nature of Res-Net allows for adaptive feature extraction at different levels of the input text. This can help in identifying more relevant words and phrases, as the network can learn increasingly complex features as it processes more data.

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

An Optimal Transport Perspective on Unpaired Image Super-Resolution

(Y)be a probability measure onY, and letG:P(Y)!R[f1g]be a functional. We recall the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation ofGat a point Q2P(Y), which is a measurable function G[Q] :Y!R[f1g such that

YG[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (16)
for all0such that Q+Qis a probability distribution.

Now we consider the three most popular GAN discrepancies D(Q0;Q) and demonstrate that their ﬁrst
variation is zero at an optimal point Q0=Q.

1. f-divergences (Nowozin et al., 2016):
Let D(Q0;Q)be an f-divergence between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

D(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (17)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of D(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (18)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that f-divergences are invariant under reparameterization (Nowozin et al., 2016):

D[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (19)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

Yh(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (20)

By the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst variation, we have

YD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (21)

Since both sides of equation (21) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Wasserstein distances (Arjovsky et al., 2017):
Let W(Q0;Q)be the Wasserstein distance between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

W(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (22)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of W(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (23)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Wasserstein distances are invariant under reparameterization (Arjovsky et al., 2017):

W[Q](y)dQ(y) = h(y)dQ(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (24)

Since Q0=Q, we have Q0=Q+Q for some measure QonYwith zero total mass. Therefore,

YW[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (25)

Since both sides of equation (25) are equal to zero, our claim is proved.

1. Maximum Mean Discrepancies (Li et al., 2017):
Let MMD(Q0;Q)be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between Q0 and Q. By deﬁnition, there exists a function h:Y!R such that

MMD(Q0;Q) = h(y)Q0 +h(y)Q. (26)

We claim that the ﬁrst variation of MMD(Q0;Q)atQ0=Q is zero:

YMMD[Q](y)dQ(y) +o() (27)

To prove the claim, we use the fact that Maximum Mean Discrepancies are invariant under reparameterization

2. The main idea is to improve the performance of blind SR by incorporating an adversarial constraint on both generators, GXY↓ and GY↓X, and an additional cycle-consistency loss.
3. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in the following aspects:

a. Combining GAN and cycle-consistency loss: The paper introduces a new perspective on blind SR by combining these two loss functions. This combination allows for better preservation of local image features and improved SR performance.

b. Adversarial constraint: The paper emphasizes the importance of imposing an adversarial constraint on both generators, GXY↓ and GY↓X. This constraint helps to optimize the generators simultaneously, leading to improved SR results.

c. Cycle-consistency loss: The paper highlights the significance of incorporating cycle-consistency loss into the framework. This loss function helps to maintain consistency between the input and output domains, resulting in more accurate and realistic SR results.

d. Application to aerial images: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework on aerial images, which have different characteristics compared to traditional image SR tasks. This novel application showcases the versatility and potential of the proposed method.

In summary, the main ideas and novelty proposed by the paper lie in the combination of GAN and cycle-consistency loss, the imposition of an adversarial constraint on both generators, and the application of the proposed framework to aerial images. These aspects contribute to the improvement of blind image SR performance and demonstrate the versatility of the method.

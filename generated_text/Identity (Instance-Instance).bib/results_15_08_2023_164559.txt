Table 8: Time and memory consumption relative to supervised

sure the time and memory consumption, for all methods we used
ResNet50-based implementations, 256-sized mini-batches and data-
distributed training with 4 Tesla V100 GPUs. We measured the
time consumption based on a single training epoch (“Time per

speciﬁed number of training epochs (“Epochs”). For OBoW, we
used its full implementation.y: for BYOL we provide the time

 epochs and the batch size of each model respectively. The ﬁrst section includes models pre-trained with a similar number of epochs as
our model (second section). We boldfaced the best results among all sections as well as of only the top two. For the linear classiﬁcation
tasks, we provide the top-1 accuracy. For object detection, we ﬁne-tuned Faster R-CNN (R50-C4) on VOC trainval07+12 and report
detection AP scores by testing on test07 . For semi-supervised learning, we ﬁne-tune the pre-trained models on 1%and10% of ImageNet
and report the top-5 accuracy. Note that, in this case the “Supervised” entry results come from [ 83] and are obtained by supervised training
using only 1%or10% of the labelled data. All the classiﬁcation results are computed with single-crop testing.y: results computed by us.

Our method achieves substantially better empirical results across the board compared to instance discrimination methods MoCo v2 and SimCLR, and even improves over the recently proposed BYOL and SwA V methods when considering a similar amount of pre-training epochs. Moreover, in VOC07 classiﬁcation and Places205 classiﬁcation, it achieves a new state of the art despite using significantly fewer pre-training epochs than related methods. On the semi-supervised ImageNet ResNet50 setting, it signiﬁcantly surpasses the state of the art for 1% labels, and is also better for 10% labels using much fewer epochs. On VOC detection, it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating strong performance improvements over supervised pre-training.

Solving Inefficiency of Self-supervised Representation Learning



1. Compare the results from the methods discussed with the state-of-the-art:

As shown in Table 2, our method achieves a single-scale center-crop top-1 accuracy of 75.9%, outperforming the latest state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin. For example, SimSiam [9] and BYOL [22] achieve 73.6% and 74.3%, respectively, while our method surpasses these results with 75.9%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art.

1. Compare the performance metrics of the discussed methods with the state-of-the-art:

To provide a comprehensive comparison, we need to analyze the performance metrics of the discussed methods in relation to the state-of-the-art. As shown in Table 2, our method achieves a single-scale center-crop top-1 accuracy of 75.9%, which is higher than the state-of-the-art methods. However, the table does not provide information on learning efﬁciency.

To address this, let's look at Table 3, which shows the object detection results on COCO 2017 for Mask-RCNN.

In Table 3, we can see that the learning efﬁciency of the state-of-the-art SSL methods is about ten times lower than the supervised learning methods. For example, the supervised learning method typically takes about 100 epochs to train a ResNet50 on ImageNet [36]. In comparison, SimCLR and BYOL have to cost 1,000 epochs, and MoCo v2 needs to cost 800 epochs (See Figure 1).

Attempting to address this issue, we rethink existing SSL methods and propose a new approach that achieves better performance and higher learning efﬁciency than the state-of-the-art SSL methods. Our proposed method uses a smoothed truncated triplet loss function and achieves a single-scale center-crop top-1 accuracy of 73.6% (200 epochs), which is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. However, our method also demonstrates higher learning efﬁciency, achieving the same accuracy with only 180 epochs, which is much fewer than the 1,000 epochs required by the state-of-the-art SSL methods.

In conclusion, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods in terms of both performance and learning efﬁciency.

CLSA outperforms MoCo V2 and SimCLV2 with 200 epochs of pre-training, achieving 69.4% top-1 accuracy. With multiple stronger augmentations, CLSA* also surpasses the state-of-the-art SWA.
2. Running Time:
CLSA achieves better results than MoCo V2 with the same running time, indicating that the optimization of contrastive loss and DDM loss can also benefit the convergence of representation learning.

Comparing the results with the state-of-the-art methods, CLSA demonstrates competitive performance. For example, BYOL, a popular unsupervised method, achieves 66.5% top-1 accuracy. However, CLSA outperforms BYOL with a larger margin (2.9% vs 0.9%).

In summary, CLSA demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. The proposed DDM loss plays a crucial role in learning from stronger augmentations, avoiding performance degeneration, and further boosting the representation for strongly augmented images.

1. Compare the results from the methods discussed with the state-of-the-art:

* MoCo-v2 [8] and HEXA MoCo: Both achieve similar performance, with HEXA MoCo slightly outperforming MoCo-v2 in some cases. However, HEXA MoCo is still behind the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, SimSiam [3], which uses a different training strategy.
* DeepCluster-v2 [3, 4] and HEXA DCluster: Both methods show competitive performance, with HEXA DCluster slightly outperforming DeepCluster-v2 in some cases. However, HEXA DCluster is still behind the SOTA method, BYOL [4], which uses a different training strategy.
* SwAV [4] and HEXA+ DCluster (8-crop): Both methods show competitive performance, with HEXA+ DCluster (8-crop) slightly outperforming SwAV in some cases. However, HEXA+ DCluster (8-crop) is still behind the SOTA method, SimSiam [3], which uses a different training strategy.

1. Compare the performance metrics:

* For contrastive methods (SimSiam [3], SimCLR [6], and BYOL [4]), the performance metrics include Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, and other relevant metrics like per-class accuracy, hard examples ratio, and linear evaluation accuracy.
* For prototype methods (MoCo [22], PCL-v2 [30], and HEXA), the performance metrics include Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, and other relevant metrics like per-class accuracy, hard examples ratio, and linear evaluation accuracy.

In summary, HEXA and its variants consistently outperform their counterparts for both contrastive and prototype methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of hard examples in improving self-supervised learning methods. However, HEXA and its variants are still behind the state-of-the-art methods, which use different training strategies.

In this setting, our method outperforms SwA V by 0:3% in Top-1 accuracy. Note that while multi-crop is responsible for 3:5% performance improvement for SwA V, for our method it provides a boost of only 0:2%. However, increasing the number of crops 

 
                         #  - -
                         # Question: How does NNCLR compare to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency?
                         # Answer: NNCLR provides a significant boost in computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the following factors:

1. Reduced reliance on data augmentation techniques: NNCLR reduces the reliance on data augmentation techniques drastically, which helps in reducing the computational overhead associated with data augmentation.
2. Nearest-neighbor selection strategy: Instead of using the entire dataset for contrastive learning, NNCLR uses a smaller support set. This reduces the computational cost of training, as the model needs to process fewer samples.
3. Reduced number of views: NNCLR uses only the larger views to calculate the NNs, which reduces the number of views needed for training. This, in turn, reduces the computational cost of training the model.

Considering these factors, NNCLR offers a more efficient alternative to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational resources required for training.
